 Let’s look at how to use this.{{pause=500}}
 It’s one of the most important lessons in Italian grammar.{{pause=500}}
 We’re learning the verb “essere”, which means “to be.” {{pause=500}}
 It’s used in almost every conversation. {{pause=500}}
 So let’s take it step by step — with examples!{{pause=500}}

{pause=500}Io{pause=500} — means “I.”
Now add the verb:
{pause=500}Io sono{pause=500} means I am.pause=500}
For example:
{pause=500}Io sono stanco{pause=500} — I’m tired.
(That’s how a man would say it. For women, it’s:
{pause=500}stanca{pause=500}.)
But in real Italian, people often drop “io” and just say:
{pause=500}Sono stanco.{pause=500}
because the verb already tells you who’s speaking!
{{pause=1000}}

Now let’s look at “you”:
{pause=500}Tu{pause=500} — this means “you.”
{pause=500}Tu sei{pause=500} — you are.
For example:
{pause=500}Tu Sei felice.{pause=500} — You’re happy.
Again, the subject can be dropped.
Most Italians would simply say:
{pause=500}Sei felice.{pause=500}
Sounds more natural that way.
{{pause=1000}}

Next:
{pause=500}Lui{pause=500} is he.
{pause=500}Lui è{pause=500} means he is.
For example:
{pause=500}Lui è alto.{pause=500} — He is tall.
You can also say just:
{pause=500}È alto.{pause=500}
But “lui” helps make it clearer.
{{pause=500}} because He and She start with the same verb. {pause=1000}

And now:
{pause=500}Lei{pause=500} is she.
{pause=500}Lei è{pause=500} means she is.
For Example:
{pause=500}Lei è simpatica.{pause=500} — She is nice.
Just like before, you can drop “lei” and say:
{pause=500}È simpatica.{pause=500}
But when you want to be clear, keep it in.
{{pause=1000}}

Let’s keep going and look at three more important forms of the verb essere – to be.
These are used when we’re talking about we, you all, and they.
{{pause=1000}}

{pause=500}Noi siamo{pause=500} means “We are.”{pause=500}
Use it when you’re talking about yourself and at least one other person.
For example:
{pause=500}Noi siamo amici.{pause=500}
That means: “We are friends.”
{{pause=1000}}

In Italian, just like before, you can drop the subject.
So instead of saying:
{pause=500}Noi siamo amici{pause=500}
You can simply say:
{pause=500}Siamo amici.{pause=500}
And it still means “We are friends.”
The verb form siamo already tells us it’s “we.”
{{pause=1000}}

Now let’s talk about {pause=500}voi {pause=500} this means “you all.”
Use it when you’re talking to more than one person.
{pause=500}Voi siete{pause=500} means “You all are.”
For example:
{pause=500}Voi siete simpatici.{pause=500}
That means: “You all are nice.”
{{pause=1000}}

Again, just like before, the subject can be dropped.
You can say:
{pause=500}Siete simpatici.{pause=500}
And it still means “You all are nice.”
{{pause=1000}}

Finally, we have {pause=500}loro {pause=500} means “they.”
{pause=500}Loro sono{pause=500} means “They are.”
For example:
{pause=500}Loro sono stanchi.{pause=500}
That means: “They are tired.”
{{pause=1000}}

And once again, Italians often drop the subject:
{pause=500}Sono stanchi.{pause=500}
That still means “They are tired.”
You know it’s “they” from the verb sono and the plural adjective.
{{pause=1000}}


You’re doing great!
Now you’ve learned all the major forms of “to be” in Italian.
🎉 That’s fantastic — bravo to you! 🇮🇹✨
