    <div class="dialogue-box">
      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Lungo</span> – "Long Coffee" (加水濃縮咖啡)<br>
      An espresso extracted with more water, resulting in a larger volume, but still strong.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Ristretto</span> – "Restricted Coffee" (少量濃縮咖啡)<br>
      A very short, highly concentrated espresso. Less water, more intense flavor.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Macchiato</span> – "Stained Coffee" (少量奶泡濃縮咖啡)<br>
      An espresso "stained" with just a dash of frothed milk on top. It's mostly coffee with a hint of milk.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Latte Macchiato</span> – "Stained Milk" (牛奶中加咖啡)<br>
      A tall glass of steamed milk that is "stained" with a shot of espresso. This means it's mostly milk with coffee added, often served in layers.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Latte</span> – "Coffee Milk" (義式拿鐵)<br>
       Similar to what's known as a "latte" internationally. It's mostly hot milk with a shot of espresso, usually served in a larger cup or glass. (Be careful: just asking for "Latte" will get you a glass of plain milk!)</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Americano</span> – "American Coffee" (美式咖啡)<br>
      <p>An espresso diluted with a larger amount of hot water. It's meant to resemble American filter coffee, but it's based on espresso.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Corretto</span> – "Corrected Coffee" (加烈酒咖啡)<br>
      An espresso "corrected" with a shot of liquor, such as grappa, sambuca, or brandy.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè Shakerato</span> – "Shaken Coffee" (冰搖咖啡)<br>
      Espresso, ice, and sometimes sugar, vigorously shaken together until frothy and chilled, then served in a martini-style glass.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Caffè con Panna</span> – "Coffee with Cream" (加鮮奶油咖啡)<br>
      An espresso topped with a generous dollop of **whipped cream (panna montata)**. It's a treat for those who enjoy a richer, sweeter coffee experience.</p>

      <p><span class="italian-word">Affogato</span> – "Drowned" (咖啡淋冰淇淋)<br>
      A scoop of vanilla ice cream "drowned" with a hot shot of espresso poured over it. It's considered a **dessert** rather than a beverage, and sometimes a shot of liqueur is added.</p>
