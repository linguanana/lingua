To get good at a language, learning how to ask questions is the absolute first step!
Today we're going to look at a few super important Italian question words. They're like keys that can open the door to conversations with Italians.

First is **Come**, which means "how" or "like."
This word is super versatile. You can use it to ask how someone is, or how something works.
For example, **Come stai?**, which means "How are you?".
Another very common one is **Come ti chiami?**, which means "What's your name?".

Next, we have **Chi**, which means "who."
You use this when you want to ask about a person.
For example, **Chi è lei?**, means "Who is she?".
Or, **Chi è lui?**, which means "Who is he?".

Another key word is **Cosa**, or **Che cosa**. Both mean "what."
They are used to ask about things or actions.
Now, here’s a small difference. **Cosa** is shorter, more common, and more casual. You'll hear this a lot in everyday conversation.
**Che cosa** is a little longer, and it sounds a bit more formal or complete. But don't worry, both are correct, and Italians use both.
For example, **Cosa fai oggi?**, means "What are you doing today?".
And, **Che cosa significa?**, means "What does it mean?".

Then we have **Dove**, which means "where."
It's perfect for asking about places or destinations.
For example, **Dove vai?**, means "Where are you going?".
And, **Dov’è il bagno?**, which means "Where is the bathroom?".

Keep practicing these! They are some of the most useful words you'll hear in Italy.
