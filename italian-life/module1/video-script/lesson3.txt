Let’s learn when to use each polite word in Italian. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=1000}}“Grazie”{{pause=500}} and {{pause=1000}}“Grazie mille”{{pause=1000}}
They both mean “thank you.” {{pause=500}}You can use either one — they’re both great!{{pause=500}}

{{pause=1000}}“Prego”{{pause=500}}
is the classic way to say “you’re welcome.”{{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it right after you say {{pause=1000}} “Grazie.” {{pause=1000}}

But actually, {{pause=500}}Prego{{pause=500}}can mean a few things. {{pause=500}}

If someone holds a door and says {{pause=500}}Prego{{pause=500}} — it means “After you.” {{pause=500}}
Or if you ask, “Can I sit here?”  {{pause=500}} they might say {{pause=1000}}Prego!{{pause=1000}} means “Go ahead!” {{pause=500}}

And in cafés or shops, {{pause=500}}Prego{{pause=500}} can mean “Next!”
 {{pause=500}} means it’s your turn to order.{{pause=500}}

 {{pause=1000}}“Di niente”{{pause=500}}
 means “no problem” or “don’t mention it.” {{pause=500}}It’s another way to say “you’re welcome.” {{pause=500}}
 It’s the kind of thing you say when you don’t want thanks to feel too serious. {{pause=1000}}
 Like saying — “No worries. Happy to help!” {{pause=500}}

{{pause=1000}}“Per favore”{{pause=500}}
means “please.” Use it when you ask for something politely.{{pause=500}}

{{pause=1000}}“Scusa”{{pause=500}}It means “excuse me” or “sorry.” {{pause=500}}
For example You bump into your friend {{pause=500}} just say: {{pause=500}}}Scusa!{{pause=500}}

{{pause=1000}}“Scusi”{{pause=500}}is formal, use it with strangers on the street or older people.{{pause=500}}

{{pause=1000}}“Mi scusi”{{pause=500}} is even more polite.
Use it when you’re trying to get someone’s attention. {{pause=1000}}

so, If you bump into someone — just say {{pause=500}}Scusa!{{pause=500}}
If you need to ask something politely — try {{pause=1000}} Mi scusi.” {{pause=500}}


{{pause=1000}}“Signore”{{pause=500}} means “Mr.” or “Sir.”{{pause=500}}
{{pause=1000}}“Signora”{{pause=500}} means “Mrs.” or “Ma’am.”{{pause=500}}

Now, we're diving into some incredibly useful Italian phrases  {{pause=500}} that'll help you communicate when you need a little assistance or just want to be polite.  {{pause=500}} Let's get started!"  {{pause=500}}
First up, if you're ever in a situation where you hear something in Italian and it just 'don't understand,' you can say:
{{pause=1000}}   Non capisco!{{pause=500}}
That means 'I don't understand.' Think about it, if you're feeling a bit confused, or if someone's speaking just too fast, this phrase is super practical! {{pause=500}}

Sometimes, it's not just about not understanding one thing, but generally feeling that your Italian skills are still growing. For that, you can clearly say:
{{pause=1000}}   Non parlo italiano molto bene.{{pause=500}}
This means 'I don't speak Italian very well.' It's a great, honest way to let people know your level, so they might speak slower or even switch to English to help you out. {{pause=500}}

Next, if you hope the other person can 'repeat' what they said, you can ask very politely:
{{pause=1000}}   Può ripetere, per favore?{{pause=500}}
That means 'Can you repeat, please?' It's a very, very polite way to ask someone to say it again. {{pause=500}}

And then, when you truly need help, you can just say this:
{{pause=1000}}   Mi può aiutare?{{pause=500}}
This phrase means 'Can you help me?' If you need directions, or any kind of assistance, just use this one. {{pause=500}}

For a slightly more formal or very polite way to ask for help, you can say:
{{pause=1000}}   Potrebbe aiutarmi, per favore?{{pause=500}}
This translates to 'Could you help me, please?' – a very respectful option for various situations. {{pause=500}}

And if you simply want to ask someone something, perhaps to get information or just start a query, you can open with:
{{pause=1000}}   Posso chiederti una cosa?{{pause=500}}
This means, 'Can I ask you something?' It's perfect for politely approaching someone with a question. {{pause=500}}

Mi dispiace.{{pause=500}}
This simply means 'I'm sorry.' You'll use this for everyday apologies. {{pause=500}}

And if something is more serious, or you want to express deeper sympathy, you can add 'molto':
{{pause=1000}}   Mi dispiace molto!{{pause=500}}
{{pause=1000}}   Un momento, per favore.{{pause=500}}
This means 'One moment, please.' It's incredibly handy when you need a little time to think, find something, or ask someone to wait briefly. {{pause=500}}

When you're happy to do something for someone, or enthusiastically agree, a lovely Italian phrase is:
{{pause=1000}}   Con piacere!{{pause=500}}
Literally, this means 'with pleasure.' So, when you're genuinely happy to offer assistance, this is the phrase to use! {{pause=500}}

And finally, when someone has done something kind or helpful for you, and you want to show your sincere gratitude, say:
{{pause=1000}}   Lo apprezzo molto.{{pause=500}}
This means, 'I appreciate it very much!' It's a warm and heartfelt way to express thanks. {{pause=500}}
