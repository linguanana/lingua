Let’s learn when to use each polite word in Italian. {{pause=2000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Grazie” and “Grazie mille”{{pause=2000}}
They both mean “thank you.”
You can use either one — they’re both great! {{pause=1000}}

---

{{pause=2000}}“Prego”{{pause=2000}}
is the classic way to say “you’re welcome.”
You’ll hear it right after you say {{pause=1000}} “Grazie.” {{pause=1000}}

But actually, {{pause=2000}}Prego{{pause=2000}} can mean a few things.
It also works when someone invites you to go first — like holding a door open.
Or if you say “Can I sit here?”, they might reply {{pause=2000}}Prego!{{pause=2000}} — meaning “Go ahead!” {{pause=1000}}

So if you hear {{pause=2000}}Prego{{pause=2000}} don’t panic —
It just means the other person is being polite! 😄 {{pause=1000}}

---

{{pause=2000}}“Per favore”{{pause=2000}}
means “please.”
Use it when you ask for something politely.
It’s simple — just add it at the end of a request. {{pause=1000}}
{{pause=2000}}“Scusa”{{pause=2000}}
is informal — say it with friends or younger people.
It means “excuse me” or “sorry.” {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Scusi”{{pause=2000}}
is formal — use it with strangers or older people.
For example, in a restaurant or on the street. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Mi scusi”{{pause=2000}}
is even more polite.
Use it when you’re trying to get someone’s attention. {{pause=1000}}

If you bump into someone — just say {{pause=2000}}Scusa!{{pause=2000}}
If you need to ask something politely — try {{pause=2000}} Mi scusi.” {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Di niente”{{pause=2000}}
means “no problem” or “don’t mention it.”
It’s another way to say “you’re welcome.” {{pause=1000}}

You might also hear people say this casually — after you thank them. {{pause=1000}}
{{pause=2000}}“Signore”{{pause=2000}}
means “Mr.” or “Sir.”
{{pause=2000}}“Signora”{{pause=2000}}
means “Mrs.” or “Ma’am.”

EN:

{{pause=2000}}“Non capisco”{{pause=2000}}
means “I don’t understand.”
Use this when you’re confused — or when someone speaks too fast! {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Può ripetere, per favore?”{{pause=2000}}
means “Can you repeat, please?”
It’s a very polite way to ask someone to say it again.
Perfect in shops, cafés, or on the street. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Mi dispiace molto”{{pause=2000}}
means “I’m very sorry.”
It’s stronger than just “sorry.”
You can use it when something bad happens, or to express sympathy. {{pause=1000}}

Now let’s look at polite phrases for meeting someone. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Piacere!”{{pause=2000}}
means “Nice to meet you.”
It’s simple and friendly — just say it with a smile. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Piacere di conoscerti”{{pause=2000}}
is the full version — and it’s informal.
Say it when you meet someone your age, or a friend of a friend. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Piacere di conoscerla”{{pause=2000}}
is the formal version.
Use it when meeting someone older, or in a professional setting. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}“Con piacere”{{pause=2000}}
means “With pleasure.”
It’s a polite response if someone says “Would you like to...?” or “Can you help me?”
Like saying “Gladly” or “Sure, happy to!” {{pause=1000}}

---

These polite expressions are short, easy, and powerful. {{pause=1000}}
They help you communicate — even when you don’t understand everything! {{pause=1000}}
Well done — and let’s keep going! 🇮🇹 {{pause=1000}}
