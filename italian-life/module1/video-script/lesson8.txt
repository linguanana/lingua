Ciao! Welcome to today’s lesson.
We’re learning one of the most important verbs in Italian — essere, which means “to be.”
You’ll use this verb all the time to say things like:
“I am,” “you are,” “She is,” and “he is.”
Let’s start with the singular forms:
I am, you are, She is, and he is.
You’ll see how simple and useful these are!
Let’s learn the key forms — and how to use them in real conversation.

Let’s look at how to use this.
It’s one of the most important lessons in Italian grammar.
We’re learning the verb **essere**, which means “to be.”
It’s used in almost every conversation.
So let’s take it step by step — with examples!
**Io** — means “I.”
Now add the verb **Io sono** means I am.
For example, **Io sono stanco** , I’m tired.That’s how a man would say it.
For women, it’s **stanca**.
But in real Italian, people often drop **Io** and just say, **Sono stanco.**
because the verb already tells you who’s speaking!
Now let’s look at “you” **Tu** — this means “you.”
**Tu sei** — you are.
For example, **Tu sei felice.** — You’re happy.
Again, the subject can be dropped.
Most Italians would simply say, **Sei felice.** Sounds more natural that way.
Next:
**Lui** is he.
**Lui è** means he is.
For example, **Lui è alto.** — He is tall.
You can also say just, **È alto.** . But **lui”** helps make it clearer, because He and She start with the same verb.
And now, **Lei** is she. **Lei è** means she is.
For example, **Lei è simpatica.** — She is nice.
Just like before, you can drop **lei** and say, **È simpatica.**
But when you want to be clear, keep it in.

Let’s keep going and look at three more important forms of the verb **essere** – to be.
These are used when we’re talking about we, you all, and they.

**Noi siamo** means “We are.”
Use it when you’re talking about yourself and at least one other person.
For example, **Noi siamo amici.** That means, “We are friends.”

In Italian, just like before, you can drop the subject.
So instead of saying **Noi siamo amici**
You can simply say **Siamo amici.**
And it still means “We are friends.
The verb form **siamo** already tells us it’s “we.”

Now let’s talk about **voi** — this means “you all.”
Use it when you’re talking to more than one person.
**Voi siete** means “You all are.”
For example **Voi siete simpatici.** That means: “You all are nice.

Again, just like before, the subject can be dropped.
You can say **Siete simpatici.**
And it still means “You all are nice.”

Finally, we have **loro** — it means “they.”
**Loro sono** means “They are.”
For example **Loro sono stanchi.** That means: “They are tired.”

And once again, Italians often drop the subject **Sono stanchi.** That still means “They are tired.”
You know it’s “they” from the verb **sono** and the plural adjective.

You’re doing great!
Now you’ve learned all the major forms of “to be” in Italian.
That’s fantastic — bravo to you.
