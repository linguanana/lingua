Let’s go over how to answer “How are you?” in Italian. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Bene{{pause=2000}} means “I’m good.”
You’ll hear it all the time — short and friendly. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Tutto bene{{pause=2000}} or {{pause=2000}}Va tutto bene{{pause=2000}} means “Everything’s good” or “Everything’s going well.”
It sounds friendly, calm, and often used in casual conversation. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Molto bene{{pause=2000}} means “very good.”
It’s positive and slightly more enthusiastic {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Sto bene{{pause=2000}} means “I’m fine.”
It’s a full sentence, but still casual. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Sto benissimo{{pause=2000}} means “I’m great!”
Use it when you’re feeling fantastic. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Così così{{pause=2000}} means “so-so.”
Not great, not terrible — just okay. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Non molto bene{{pause=2000}} means “not very well.”
Say this if you’re feeling down, but want to be polite. {{pause=1000}}

{{pause=2000}}Sono stanco{{pause=2000}} (for males) or {{pause=2000}}Sono stanca{{pause=2000}} (for females) means “I’m tired.”
A common and honest answer. {{pause=1000}}

And finally — {{pause=2000}}E tu?{{pause=2000}}

Always polite to ask back! {{pause=1000}}
