(Same as Slide 2)

EN (English narration):~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{{control=happy,2}} Ciao! {{control=happy,2}}
This is the most famous Italian word — and you’ll hear it everywhere. {{pause=500}}
It’s super casual, and guess what? It means both “hi” and “bye”! {{control=happy,1}}

{{control=happy,2}} Salve! {{control=happy,2}}
This one is polite and neutral — great for when you don’t know the person well. {{pause=500}}
It works at any time of day, and it’s safer than “Ciao” if you want to sound respectful. {{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it at hotel front desks, shops, and with older people. {{control=happy,1}}

{{control=happy,2}} Buongiorno! {{control=happy,2}}
This means “Good morning.” {{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it from morning until the late afternoon — sometimes even until 5 PM —
because it also means “Have a good day.” {{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it in cafés, stores, and even just walking down the street. {{control=happy,1}}

{{control=happy,2}} Buon pomeriggio! {{control=happy,2}}
This one means “Good afternoon,” but it’s not used as often as Buongiorno. {{pause=500}}
You might hear it in formal settings — especially in schools or on the news. {{pause=500}}
Still, it’s nice to know — and it shows you’re learning Italian with style! {{control=happy,1}}

{{control=happy,2}} Buonasera! {{control=happy,2}}
This means “Good evening.” {{pause=500}}
If you’re walking into a restaurant for dinner, you can say {{control=happy,2}} Buonasera.
And you might hear them say {{control=happy,2}} Buonasera to you first. {{pause=500}}
It sounds elegant, and Italians love it when you say it right. {{control=happy,1}}

{{control=happy,2}} Buonanotte! {{control=happy,2}}
This one means “Good night.” {{pause=500}}
Say it when someone’s going to bed — it’s not for casual goodbyes. {{pause=500}}
It’s warm, soft, and full of care. {{control=happy,1}}

(Same as Slide 5)

EN (English narration):~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arrivederci — a very common goodbye. {{pause=500}}
Use it in restaurants, hotels, or shops. {{pause=1000}}

Ciao! This one is casual — perfect with friends. {{pause=1000}}

A dopo — you’ll see this person again today. {{pause=1000}}
It’s used when you’re not sure what time. {{pause=1000}}

A più tardi! It means “later today” and feels more specific. {{pause=1000}}
For example: you go out for lunch but will come back to work —
so you say: {{control=happy,1}} “A più tardi!” {{pause=1000}}

A domani — for when you’ll see someone tomorrow. {{pause=1000}}

Alla prossima — “until next time,” open-ended. {{pause=1000}}

Alla prossima settimana — for next week. {{pause=1000}}

A presto — soft and kind. It means “soon,” without saying when. {{pause=1000}}

Ci vediamo — when you’ll see them in person. {{pause=1000}}

Ci sentiamo — for calls or messages. Like “Talk soon!” {{pause=1000}}

Buona giornata! — say it when someone’s heading out for the day. {{pause=1000}}

Buona serata! — say this in the evening. Polite and warm. {{pause=1000}}
