{{control=happy,2}} Ciao!  {{control=happy,2}}
This is the most famous Italian word — and you’ll hear it everywhere. {{pause=500}}
It’s super casual, and guess what? It means both “hi” and “bye”!  {{control=happy,1}}

{{control=happy,2}} Salve!  {{control=happy,2}}
This one is polite and neutral — great for when you don’t know the person well. {{pause=500}}
It works at any time of day, and it’s safer than “Ciao” if you want to sound respectful. {{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it at hotel front desks, shops, and with older people.  {{control=happy,1}}

 {{control=happy,2}} Buongiorno!  {{control=happy,2}}
This means “Good morning.” {{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it from morning until the late afternoon — sometimes even until 5 PM — because it also means “Have a good day.” {{pause=500}}
You’ll hear it in cafés, stores, and even just walking down the street.  {{control=happy,1}}

 {{control=happy,2}} Buon pomeriggio!   {{control=happy,2}}
This one means “Good afternoon,” but it’s not used as often as Buongiorno. {{pause=500}}
You might hear it in formal settings, especially in schools or on the news. {{pause=500}}
Still, it’s nice to know — and it shows you’re learning Italian with style!  {{control=happy,1}}

 {{control=happy,2}} Buonasera!   {{control=happy,2}}}
This means “Good evening.” {{pause=500}}
If you’re walking into a restaurant for dinner, you can say  {{control=happy,2}}Buonasera {{control=happy,2}}
or you might hear them say  {{control=happy,2}}Buonasera {{control=happy,2}} to you first. {{pause=500}}
It sounds elegant, and Italians love it when you say it right.  {{control=happy,1}}

 {{control=happy,2}} Buonanotte!  {{control=happy,2}}
This one means “Good night.” {{pause=500}}
Say it when someone’s going to bed — it’s not for casual goodbyes. {{pause=500}}
It’s warm, soft, and full of care.  {{control=happy,1}}

(slide 6: Speech: English 講稿) ~~~~~

Arrivederci {{pause=1000}}
— a very common goodbye. {{pause=500}}
Use it in restaurants, hotels, or shops. {{pause=1000}}

Ciao! {{pause=1000}}
This one is casual, {{pause=500}}
perfect with friends. {{pause=1000}}

A dopo {{pause=1000}}
You’ll see this person again today. {{pause=1000}}
It’s used when you’re not sure what time. {{pause=1000}}

A più tardi! {{pause=1000}}
This one means “later today” — but feels more specific. {{pause=1000}}
For example: You go out for lunch,
but you’ll come back to work after —
so you say:  {{control=happy,1}}“A più tardi!” {{pause=1000}}

A domani {{pause=1000}}
This is used when you’ll see someone tomorrow. {{pause=1000}}

Alla prossima {{pause=1000}}
This means “until next time” — it’s open-ended. {{pause=1000}}

Alla prossima settimana {{pause=1000}}
Use this if you’ll see them next week. {{pause=1000}}

A presto {{pause=1000}}
This one is soft and kind —
it means “soon,” but doesn’t say when. {{pause=1000}}

Ci vediamo {{pause=1000}}
Use this when you’ll see them in person. {{pause=1000}}

Ci sentiamo {{pause=1000}}
This one is for calls or messages —
like "Talk soon!” {{pause=1000}}

Buona giornata! {{pause=1000}}
Say this when someone is heading out during the day. {{pause=1000}}

Buona serata! {{pause=1000}}
And this one is used in the evening — polite and warm. {{pause=1000}}
