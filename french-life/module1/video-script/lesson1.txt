Today, we're going to learn some basic French greetings.
First, the most common and simple greeting is ***Salut*** this means, Hi! and bye!. It's an informal greeting, best used with friends and family.
For a very playful greeting, you can say ***Coucou!*** This is a very playful "Hi there!" and is only for close friends or kids .
Next, for a more formal or general greeting ***Bonjour!*** This means "Hello!" or "Good day!" .You can use it from morning until late afternoon .
If it's in the afternoon, you can say ***Bon apr√®s-midi*** This means "Good afternoon!" . However, this phrase is not very common in daily conversation . and is mostly used in more formal settings, such as in news broadcasts, or as a professional greeting .
In the evening, we switch to ***Bonsoir!*** This means, Good evening! .
Finally, when you're going to bed, you would say ***Bonne nuit***  This means "Good night!" and is only used to wish someone a good night's sleep .

Now, let's move on to some common French farewells.
The most common and formal way to say goodbye is **Au revoir** . This simply means, Goodbye.
This is a safe choice to use with anyone you don't know well, such as after shopping or leaving a restaurant.
For an informal farewell, just like with greetings, **Salut** can also be used.
**Salut** means "Bye!" and is informal, you'd use this with friends or family.
If you know you'll see the person again soon, you can say **√Ä bient√¥t**. This means: See you soon.
If you are seeing them again later on the same day, you would say **√Ä tout √† l‚Äôheure**, this means, See you in a little bit.
A more general way to say, See you later is **√Ä plus tard**. This means, See you later.
If you know you'll see them tomorrow, say **√Ä demain** This means, See you tomorrow.
When you're not sure when you'll see them again, you can use **√Ä la prochaine** this means, Until next time.
If you know it's next week, you can be more specific **√Ä la semaine prochaine** This means, See you next week.
You can also use these two casual phrases **On se voit** This means, We'll see each other.
and **On se parle** This means, We'll talk soon.
Finally, you can also use wishes as farewells **Bonne journ√©e**. This means, Have a good day.
and **Bonne soir√©e**. This means, Have a good evening.
These are all the basic ways to say goodbye in French!
